## Overview


## Development
This project follows the best practices we currently rely on for building maintainable Python projects. We use:

- **`uv`** for dependency management  
- **`pre-commit`** for automated code quality checks  
- **`Ruff`** for linting and formatting (a VS Code configuration is included)  
- **`Makefile`** to run common commands consistently

### Requirements
- **Python 3.12**
- **`uv`** (recommended) for dependency management and to automatically create the package link for a smoother development workflow
- **`make`** (recommended) to use the provided Makefile commands

### Environment setup
Install dependencies and set up `pre-commit` hooks:
```bash
make install
```

### Code quality

Run linting/formatting checks via `pre-commit`:
```bash
make pre-commit
```
